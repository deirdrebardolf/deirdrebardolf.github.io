Deirdre received her associate’s degree from Nassau Community College in 2015 and transferred to SUNY Old Westbury. She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Media & Communications in the spring of 2017. Upon graduation, she was awarded the Academic Excellence award, the Excellence in Writing award, and a MAC Award for her article, National Geographic’s Gender Revolution with Katie Couric.

Deirdre has reported for Old Westbury’s school newspaper, The Catalyst, focusing on gender and politics and spearheading a column for alumni profiles. She was named Editor in Chief of Her Campus at Old Westbury as well. In the fall of 2016, Deirdre volunteered as a Lead Animation Assistant for Monster in the Closet, an animated video installation exhibited at the New York Hall of Science.

A great experience that has helped define her perspective has been working and volunteering at the Double H Ranch, a summer camp for children with life-threatening illnesses. When she’s not interning or going to class, she enjoys reading, traveling, and yoga.</p>
